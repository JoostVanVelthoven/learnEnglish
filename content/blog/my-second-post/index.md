I love <CompleteText answer="blogging" placeholder="ведение блога"/> so much already.

Did you <CompleteText answer="know" placeholder="знать" /> that "despite its name, salted duck eggs can also be made from
chicken <text title="haha">eggs</text>, though the taste and texture will be somewhat different, and the
egg yolk will be less rich."?
([Wikipedia Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg))
